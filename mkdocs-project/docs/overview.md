# Git Overview

Git is software that provides version control for software and other files.
Although Git is commonly used to track file versions for software projects,
it can also be used for website content (like this documentation), and other project files.

Git software must be installed on the local computer, which allows interacting with the local repository files
and also integrates with Git hosted in the cloud such as
[GitHub](http://github.com) and [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org).

## Git Account

In order to use GitHub or Bitbucket, you must sign up for an account.
In general the account is associated with a person, and the email that is used will be associated with an organization.
Personal repositories can be created and may incur a cost of not public (open source).
Repositories associated with an organization are paid for by the organization.
