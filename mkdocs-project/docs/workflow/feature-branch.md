# Git Workflow / Feature Branch

A feature branch workflow approach is appropriate for individual users and teams where
work often involves smaller feature changes and bug fixes.

The "master" branch is considered to be the development branch and feature branches
are created for small enhancements.

An alternative is to create a "develop" branch off of master,
which is used for larger development timelines and can itself have branches to add specific features.
