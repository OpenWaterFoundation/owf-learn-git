# Install Git Software / Command Line Software

Git command-line tools are useful when using Git commands from a terminal window.
The following choices will also install stand-alone graphical user interface (GUI) tools,
meaning that the tools are not part of an integrated developer environment.

See the [Getting Started - Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) documentation.

## Install Git on Cygwin

```

## Install Git on Windows

## Next Steps
